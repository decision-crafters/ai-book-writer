# Outline Generator

The `outline_generator.py` file contains the logic for generating book outlines.

## Overview

This script is likely responsible for taking a book topic or idea and generating a structured outline that can be used by the `book_generator.py` to create the actual book content. It might involve:

- Taking user input for the book topic or title.
- Using an LLM to generate a hierarchical outline with chapters and sub-sections.
- Providing options to customize the outline (e.g., number of chapters, specific topics to include).

## Purpose

The `outline_generator.py` script helps to streamline the book creation process by providing a well-structured starting point.

## Documentation Needs

- Detailed explanation of the outline generation process.
- Documentation of the command-line arguments or configuration options available for `outline_generator.py`.
- Explanation of how different LLMs are used in the outline generation process.
- Guidance on how to customize the outline generation process.
