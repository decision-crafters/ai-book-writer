# Environment Variables

The application utilizes environment variables for configuration, allowing for sensitive information and environment-specific settings to be managed outside of the codebase.

## Overview

- **`.env`**: This file is used to define the environment variables for your local development environment. This file is typically not committed to version control.
- **`env.example`**: This file provides an example of the environment variables that the application expects. It serves as a template and should be copied to `.env` and then modified with your specific values.

## Purpose

Using environment variables provides several benefits:

- **Security**: Sensitive information like API keys and database credentials can be kept out of the codebase.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Different settings can be used for development, testing, and production environments without modifying the code.
- **Ease of Deployment**: Configuration can be easily managed in different deployment environments.

## Usage

1. **Copy `env.example` to `.env`**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
2. **Modify `.env`**: Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual settings.
3. **Load Environment Variables**: The application uses a library like `python-dotenv` to load the variables defined in the `.env` file.

## Important Environment Variables

*(This section should be populated with descriptions of the key environment variables used by the application. This information can be gathered by inspecting the `config.py` and `settings.py` files.)*

## Documentation Needs

- A comprehensive list of all environment variables used by the application, with descriptions of their purpose and expected values.
- Instructions on how to set up environment variables in different deployment environments.
- Best practices for managing environment variables.
