## Purpose

These templates likely provide default configurations, outlines, or structures that the `book_generator.py` uses to create books. They offer a starting point and can be customized further.

## Usage

When generating a book, the user or the system can select a template from this directory based on the desired genre or subject matter. The `book_generator.py` then reads and utilizes the selected template to guide the book creation process.

## Documentation Needs

- Detailed documentation for each template file, explaining the specific configurations and structures they provide.
- Explanation of how these templates are used by `book_generator.py`.
- Instructions on how to create new templates or modify existing ones.
- Clarification on the purpose of `gemini_flash.py` and `o1_preview.py`.
