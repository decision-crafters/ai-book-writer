# Utilities

The `utils` directory contains utility modules that provide common functionalities used throughout the application.

## Overview

Currently, the `utils` directory contains:

- **`__init__.py`**:  Makes the `utils` directory a Python package.

## Purpose

Utility modules typically contain helper functions, classes, or constants that are not specific to any particular part of the application but are used in multiple places to perform common tasks.

## Documentation Needs

- Detailed documentation of the modules and functions within the `utils` directory, explaining their purpose and usage. As of now, only the `__init__.py` file exists, so documentation should reflect the intended purpose of this directory and any future utility modules.
