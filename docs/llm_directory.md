# LLM Directory (`llm/`)

The `llm/` directory contains the code related to interacting with different Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Overview

This directory likely includes:

- **`__init__.py`**:  An empty file that marks the `llm` directory as a Python package.
- **`deepseek_client.py`**:  Code for interacting with the DeepSeek LLM.
- **`factory.py`**:  A factory class or functions for creating instances of different LLM clients. This helps in abstracting the specific LLM implementation being used.
- **`interface.py`**:  Abstract base classes or interfaces defining the common methods that all LLM clients should implement. This promotes consistency and allows for easy swapping of LLM implementations.
- **`litellm_base.py`**:  Potentially a base class or implementation using the LiteLLM library, which provides a unified interface for interacting with various LLMs.
- **`litellm_implementations.py`**: Specific implementations of LLM clients using the LiteLLM library.
- **`mistral_nemo.py`**: Code for interacting with the Mistral-Nemo LLM.
- **`prompt.py`**:  Utilities or classes for managing and constructing prompts that are sent to the LLMs.
- **`register_model_clients.py`**: Code for registering different LLM client implementations with the factory.

## Purpose

The `llm/` directory encapsulates the logic for interacting with various LLMs, making it easier to switch between different models and manage the integration of LLMs into the book generation process.

## Documentation Needs

- Detailed explanation of the architecture and design of the LLM integration.
- Documentation for each module within the `llm/` directory, explaining its purpose and how it works.
- Explanation of how to add support for new LLMs.
- Examples of how to use the LLM clients and prompting utilities.
