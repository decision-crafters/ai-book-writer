# Configuration

The `config` directory contains files responsible for configuring the application's behavior.

## Overview

The key configuration files and their purposes are:

- **`__init__.py`**:  Makes the `config` directory a Python package.
- **`environments.py`**: Defines different configuration environments (e.g., development, production). This allows you to have different settings based on the environment the application is running in.
- **`settings.py`**:  Stores the main application settings. This file is used to define various parameters that control how the application functions.

## Key Concepts

### Configuration Environments

The application supports different configuration environments, allowing you to tailor settings for specific scenarios. For example, you might have different database connection details for development and production environments.

### Application Settings

The `settings.py` file centralizes important application settings. These settings can control various aspects of the application, such as:

- LLM model configurations
- API keys
- File paths
- Feature flags

## Usage

### Setting up Environments

You can define different environments in `environments.py` and then specify which environment to use when running the application (e.g., via an environment variable).

### Modifying Settings

The `settings.py` file can be modified to adjust the application's behavior. It's important to understand the purpose of each setting before making changes.

## Documentation Needs

- Detailed documentation of all available settings in `settings.py`.
- Explanation of how to properly set up and switch between different environments.
- Guidance on how to add new configuration settings.
