# Agents

The `agents.py` file likely defines agents that interact with the LLMs to perform specific tasks in the book generation process.

## Overview

The `agents.py` file probably contains classes or functions that represent different types of agents. These agents might be responsible for tasks such as:

- Generating outlines
- Writing chapters
- Editing content
- Fact-checking

## Purpose

The use of agents can help to modularize the book generation process, making it easier to manage and extend. Each agent can be designed to perform a specific task, and these agents can be orchestrated to create the final book.

## Documentation Needs

- Detailed documentation of the different agents defined in `agents.py`, explaining their roles, responsibilities, and how they interact with each other and the LLMs.
- Explanation of how to create new agents or modify existing ones.
- Examples of how agents are used in the book generation workflow.
