# config.py

The `config.py` file likely serves as a central configuration module, loading settings and making them available throughout the application.

## Overview

This file might contain logic for:

- Loading settings from environment variables.
- Reading configuration files (e.g., `settings.py`).
- Defining default configuration values.
- Providing functions or classes to access configuration parameters.

## Purpose

Centralizing configuration in `config.py` makes it easier to manage application settings and ensures that different parts of the application use a consistent set of configurations.

## Documentation Needs

- Detailed explanation of how `config.py` loads and manages application settings.
- Documentation of the functions, classes, or variables provided by `config.py` for accessing configuration values.
- Explanation of how to override default configurations using environment variables or configuration files.
