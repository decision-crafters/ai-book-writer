# Book Generator

The `book_generator.py` file contains the core logic for generating books using the configured LLMs and templates.

## Overview

This script is likely responsible for orchestrating the entire book creation process. It might involve the following steps:

1. **Reading Configuration**: Loading settings from the `config` directory to determine which LLM to use, output paths, and other parameters.
2. **Selecting a Template**: Choosing a book template from the `config_templates` directory based on user input or default settings.
3. **Generating an Outline**: Using an LLM or predefined structures to create a book outline.
4. **Generating Content**: Utilizing LLMs to write the actual content for each chapter or section of the book.
5. **Formatting and Output**: Saving the generated content into the desired format (e.g., Markdown, PDF).

## Purpose

The `book_generator.py` script automates the process of creating books, leveraging the power of LLMs and customizable templates.
