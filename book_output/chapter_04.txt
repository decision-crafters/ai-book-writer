Chapter 4

Dane walked into the executive boardroom, the grandeur of the space hitting him like a wave. The room was filled with high-ranking executives, their eyes focused on him as he made his way to the front. Dane could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on him, his heart pounding in his chest.

Gary, his mentor and guide in this journey, approached him with a reassuring smile. "You've got this, Dane. Just be yourself and trust in your work," Gary whispered, his words a lifeline in the sea of anxiety that threatened to overwhelm Dane.

Taking a deep breath, Dane nodded gratefully at Gary before turning to face the room. With a shaky voice, he began to explain the intricate workings of the algorithm he had poured his heart and soul into. Despite his discomfort with public speaking, Dane's passion for his work shone through as he delved into the predictions made by the algorithm.

The executives listened intently, their expressions ranging from curiosity to skepticism. Dane could feel their eyes on him, assessing his every word and gesture. The formal and imposing setting only added to his nerves, but he pushed through, determined to showcase the potential of his creation.

As he spoke, Dane's confidence grew, fueled by Gary's unwavering support and the belief in the power of his algorithm. With each passing minute, he found his rhythm, his nervousness giving way to a sense of purpose and determination. The room may have been daunting, but Dane was determined to make his mark and prove the value of his work.
