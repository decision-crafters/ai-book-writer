Chapter 2

Dane's Apartment was a whirlwind of chaos as the blaring sound of his alarm clock shattered the early morning silence. Dane jolted awake, his heart racing as he checked the time on his phone. "Oh no, no, no!" he muttered under his breath, realizing he had overslept. 

With a sense of urgency, Dane threw back the covers and leaped out of bed, his feet hitting the cold floor. The cluttered room seemed to mock him as he scanned the mess for his misplaced notes and laptop. Papers were strewn across the desk, empty coffee cups lined up like soldiers, and clothes lay haphazardly on the chair. 

"Where are they?!" Dane muttered, frantically searching through the sea of disorder. His hands finally closed around his laptop, but his notes were nowhere to be found. Panic surged through him as he tore through the piles of paper, cursing his lack of organization.

In a frenzy, Dane rummaged through drawers and cabinets, his heart pounding in his chest. The minutes seemed to slip away like sand through his fingers, each second ticking louder in his ears. Finally, with a mix of relief and frustration, he found his notes buried under a stack of old magazines.

Snatching them up, Dane dashed to the bathroom to splash water on his face, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep. His reflection in the mirror looked back at him with a mix of determination and worry. "You can do this," he whispered to himself, trying to steel his nerves for the impending presentation.

As he hurriedly dressed, Dane realized his keys and wallet were missing. "Not now, not now," he muttered, retracing his steps in a frantic attempt to locate them. After a few tense minutes of searching, he finally found them under a pile of clothes on the chair. 

With his belongings in hand, Dane rushed out of his apartment, locking the door behind him. The neon lights of the urban environment flickered overhead, casting a surreal glow on the bustling streets. He hailed a cab, the driver giving him a quizzical look at his disheveled appearance.

Settling into the back seat, Dane's mind raced with thoughts of the important presentation looming ahead. The weight of his disorganized morning pressed down on him, a stark reminder of the consequences of his chaotic lifestyle. As the cab weaved through traffic, Dane's thoughts turned inward, a resolve forming in his mind to better manage his time and responsibilities in the future.
