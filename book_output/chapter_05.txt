Chapter 5

Dane stood at the head of the long, polished table in the executive boardroom, his palms slightly clammy as he faced the expectant gazes of the executives. Jonathan Morego, a senior member known for his skepticism, raised an eyebrow. "Dane, your algorithm predicts a market crash. Care to explain the basis of this prediction?"

Dane straightened his posture, trying to exude confidence. "Yes, Mr. Morego. The algorithm analyzes historical data, market trends, and various indicators to make its predictions. It's a complex system, but the results have been highly accurate in our testing."

Morego leaned back in his chair, his expression unreadable. "Highly accurate, you say? Yet, we've seen no evidence of this in real-world scenarios. How can we trust your algorithm when the stakes are so high?"

Dane felt the weight of doubt pressing down on him. He delved into the technical aspects of the algorithm, explaining its intricate processes and the logic behind its predictions. As he spoke, some executives nodded in understanding, while others furrowed their brows in contemplation.

The tension in the room grew palpable as the debate unfolded. Executives posed probing questions, challenging Dane's methodology and demanding concrete proof of the algorithm's reliability. Dane defended his work with fervor, his voice unwavering despite the doubts swirling around him.

As the discussion reached a crescendo, Dane could sense the pivotal moment approaching. The fate of his algorithm hung in the balance, and he knew that how he handled this confrontation would shape its future. With a steely resolve, Dane braced himself for the final verdict that would determine the trajectory of his groundbreaking creation.
